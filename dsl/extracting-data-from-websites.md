# Scraping

üí° **Let's assume a pretty basic scenario. We want to make a request to a github profile page and extract the nickname of the profiles owner as well as getting the names of them pinned repositories.** 

### Documentation by Example

All of the interesting parts are marked with  an \(‚ÑπÔ∏è\) and explained at the bottom of the code sample.

```kotlin
import it.skrape.extract
import it.skrape.selects.htmlDocument
import it.skrape.skrape

data class MyScrapedData(
    val userName: String, 
    val repositoryNames: List<String>
)

fun main() {
    val githubUserData = skrape {
        url = "https://github.com/skrapeit" //‚ÑπÔ∏è1
        
        extract {
            htmlDocument {
                MyScrapedData(
                    userName = select(".h-card .p-nickname").text(), //‚ÑπÔ∏è2
                    repositoryNames = select("span.repo").map { it.text() } //‚ÑπÔ∏è3
                )
            }
        }
    }
    println("${githubUserData.userName}'s repos are ${githubUserData.repositoryNames}")
}
```

{% code title="Will print extracted data to the console" %}
```bash
> skrapeit's repos are [skrape.it]
```
{% endcode %}

1‚É£ We are in the scope of skrape{} here. This is the place to configure your request. The code example we are only defining the url we want to make a request against but there are a lot [**more options to configure the request**](parse-html-from-web.md).

2‚É£ To select the first occurrence of an element within the html tree you can use the `el()` function in the scope of `extract{}`. It is expecting an CSS selector String and will return an object of type`Element`.  
There's a lot you can do with an `Element`, in this example we just want to get its text. You can find a full list of the methods `Element` offers over [**here**](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/nodes/Element.html).

3‚É£ To select ALL occurrences of an element within the html tree you can use the `$()` function in the scope of `extract{}`. It is expecting an CSS selector String and will return an `Elements` object. Elements is basically an `ArrayList<Element>.`  
You can find a full list of the methods `Elements` offers over [**here**](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/select/Elements.html).
