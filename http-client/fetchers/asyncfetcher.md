# AsyncFetcher

Skrape{it} provides different fetcher implementations. All of the Fetchers behave different and you should pick them depending on your needs.

The `AsyncFetcher` is a none-blocking http client. It will send an HTTP-request \(with [given request parameters](../request-options.md), headers etc.\) to a given url and returns a result that consists of the http response status as well as of the response headers and body in a none-blocking fashion by the use of coroutines. Thereby it can be convenient called from a suspend function.

**It is fast, robust and result will look simular to what you would get when surfing a page in your browser with deactivated Javascript.**

Thereby it is the best pick if you want to call websites in parallel or at least from a coroutine scope and if you just don't care about the excecution of a websites Javascript.
